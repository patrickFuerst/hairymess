# HairyMess


HairyMess is a R&D project exploring the capabilities of Compute Shaders within OpenGL.

Developed with openFrameworks, it uses the Position-Based-Dynamics algorithm (PBD) combined with a volumetric method
for hair simulation (Paper).
Inextensibility of hair strands can be computationally expensive because it takes a couple of iterations to satisfy the length constraint. This is where the Dynamic-Follow-the-Leader approach (DFTL) comes into play.

Currently Iâ€™m working on implementing Deep-Opacity-Shadow maps for self shadowing.
